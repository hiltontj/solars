## Overview

`solars` is a learning tool for exploring our solar system. Originally developed as a quick way to visualize planetary alignment on a given date, `solars` is also a foray into application design and the world of application development using [Tauri][tauri-app].

The <b><span style="color: #f29950;">rs</span></b> in solars is a nod to the [Rust Programming Language][rust-lang], which `solars`, being a Tauri app, is built upon, and from which the [`chrono`][chrono-crate] and [`astro`][astro-crate] crates derive.
